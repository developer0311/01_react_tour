# **Mapping Components**

Mapping components in React is a powerful technique used to dynamically create multiple instances of a component based on data. This is especially useful when working with lists, enabling developers to render reusable components efficiently.

---

## **Why Use Mapping in React**

1. **Dynamic Rendering**: Allows the creation of multiple components from an array of data without manually writing each one.
2. **Code Reusability**: Reduces redundancy by reusing the same component with different data.
3. **Scalability**: Enables handling large datasets easily by leveraging array methods like `.map()`.

For example, mapping can be used to display a list of cards, each containing unique contact information.

## **Simple Map with Example**

### JavaScript `.map()` Function:

The `.map()` method creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((number) => number * number);

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Explanation:

- **Input**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- **Transformation Function**: Multiplies each number by itself.
- **Output**: New array `[1, 4, 9, 16]`.

## **React Map with Example**

### React Component Using `.map()`:

Here's how mapping is used to render a list of components dynamically.

#### File Structure:

- **App.js**: Main component where mapping happens.
- **Card.js**: Reusable component for displaying contact details.
- **contacts.js**: Data source containing an array of contact objects.

#### `App.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Card from "./Card";
import contacts from "../contacts";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1 className="heading">My Contacts</h1>
      {contacts.map((contact) => {
        return (
          <Card
            key={contact.id}
            id={contact.id}
            name={contact.name}
            img={contact.imgURL}
            tel={contact.phone}
            email={contact.email}
          />
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### `contacts.js`

```javascript
const contacts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "John Doe",
    imgURL: "john.jpg",
    phone: "123-456-7890",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Jane Doe",
    imgURL: "jane.jpg",
    phone: "987-654-3210",
    email: "jane.doe@example.com",
  },
];

export default contacts;
```

#### `Card.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";

function Card(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.name}</h2>
      <img src={props.img} alt="avatar" />
      <p>{props.tel}</p>
      <p>{props.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Card;
```

## **Why Unique Key is Needed in Mapping Components**

React requires a unique `key` for each child in a list to:

1. **Enhance Performance**: Helps React identify which elements have changed, been added, or removed during updates.
2. **Maintain Component State**: Prevents loss of component state during re-renders.

### **Difference Between `key` and `id`**

| **Key**                            | **ID**                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Used by React internally.          | Part of the data structure.              |
| Ensures efficient rendering.       | Represents a unique identifier for data. |
| Should not be accessible in props. | Passed as a prop for data access.        |

### Example:

```jsx
<Card key={contact.id} id={contact.id} />
```

- **`key`**: Used internally by React for reconciliation.
- **`id`**: Passed as a prop to the `Card` component for rendering data.

Using mapping with unique keys ensures efficient and predictable rendering in React applications while promoting clean, reusable code.
